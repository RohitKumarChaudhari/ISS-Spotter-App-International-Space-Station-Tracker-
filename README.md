# ISS-Spotter-App-International-Space-Station-Tracker-
This is a simple Python project that uses a public API to check when the **International Space Station (ISS)** is passing over your location. It sends a notification or prints a message if the ISS is overhead **and** it's dark outside â€” the perfect time to spot it in the sky!
